## AWS Resource Scaling Project
This repository contains the implementation for a cloud-based solution designed to dynamically scale web service instances based on the incoming traffic load. 
The solution utilizes AWS services such as EC2, Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), Auto Scaling Groups, and CloudWatch to ensure high availability and maintain the Quality of Service (QoS) for a web service under varying loads.

## Works
Design and implement solutions to programmatically provision and deprovision cloud resources according to dynamic load conditions.  
Configure and deploy Elastic Load Balancers and Auto Scaling Groups on AWS.  
Develop monitoring solutions to manage cloud resources effectively and deal with resource failure scenarios.  
Analyze workload patterns and develop elasticity policies to ensure QoS.  
Implement cost-effective resource provisioning while analyzing performance trade-offs due to budget constraints.  
Utilize AWS SDKs & CLI tools for automation and efficient cloud resource management.  
Use Terraform for infrastructure orchestration on the cloud.
